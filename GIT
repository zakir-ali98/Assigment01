<h2>Git is a version control software which you need to install on your local system in order to use it. For an individual
 working on a project alone, Git proves to be an excellent software. But what if you are working on a project with a
 large team. All will be working on the same project but each of you will be having a different version of the same 
project. Suppose you have made changes in the project directory on your machine and you want to send those changes 
to your collaborators. Also, you want the changes they make to appear directly in your machineâ€™s project directory.
 As working on a project, being on the same page with your teammates is very crucial to avoid any type of conflict.
 So, how you will do that? Well, no worries Git takes care of all but the only condition here is, each of your team
 members must have Git installed on their systems.
