<h2>Agile
 is a lean software development practice that follows an incremental approach to the development process. 
It minimizes the risk of building obsolete software by speeding up the SDLC and incorporating continuous feedback
 from internal teams and customers throughout every sprint.


DevOps,
 on the other hand, is a methodology used to bring development and IT operations teams closer together.
 It represents the improvement to cross-team collaboration and transparency â€“ breaking down the communication and
 systematic barriers that existed historically between software development and operations teams.
