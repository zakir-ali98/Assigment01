<h2>  ==CI/CD==

Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) embody a culture, set of operating principles, and collection 
of practices that enable application development teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably.
 The implementation is also known as the CI/CD pipeline. 

CI/CD is one of the best practices for devops teams to implement. It is also an agile methodology best practice, 
as it enables software development teams to focus on meeting business requirements, code quality, and security because
 deployment steps are automated.</h2>
